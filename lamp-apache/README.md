# LAMP-Stack with Apache

##Description
This project installs and configures a simple LAMP-stack with apache2, mysql and php5 on a Ubuntu 14.04 Server.
Either Chef and puppet are supported to automatically run the necessary tasks. The scripts speed up the process of setting up a fully equipped LAMP-Stack for people who don't want to deal with details about how to configure single parts of the stack.

* Puppet (tested with version 3.7)

##Platforms
* Ubuntu 14 and older (should also work on later versions
