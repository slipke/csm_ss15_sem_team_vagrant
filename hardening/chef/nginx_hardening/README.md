# nginx_hardening - Chef cookbook

## Description
This cookbook brings secure nginx settings to your system. It installs/updates the openssl and nginx package and provides you with a secure and easy to manage nginx configuration. 
All changes are made in "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf". Besides the nginx hardening, this cookbook also gives you the option of a very basic, tailored system optimization. 
Please refer to the section [Attributes](#Attributes) for further information. The hardening and install/update recipes are seperate and can be included or excluded at will.
