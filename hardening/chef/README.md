# ssh_hardening
STILL IN PROGRESS

This cookbook creates users with ssh keys and hardens the ssh settings. 

#It depends on the official "users" cookbook. Install it with "berks cookbook 'users' '~> 1.8.2' and cd into the #directory and run "bundle Install". To install the users and ssh keys please refer to #https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/users
