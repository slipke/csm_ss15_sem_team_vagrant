# mysql_hardening - Chef cookbook

## Description
This cookbook installs or updates the mysql package via the system package manager and runs several securing actions. 
Essentially this cookbook rewrites the, already in the mysql-server package included, "mysql_secure_installation" script for chef automation.
The hardening and install/update recipes are seperate and can be included or excluded at will.

## Requirements
* [Chef Server, Client or Chef-dk](https://www.chef.io) (tested with Chef version 12.x)
* [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/)

## Platforms 
* Debian 8 and later (tested, should work with older versions, too)
* Ubuntu 14 and later (tested, should work with older versions, too)

## Dependencies
The [opscode apt cookbook](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/apt) makes sure, the apt repos√≠tory list is up to date. 
Berkshelf is used as a dependency management tool. To resolve and install all the Dependencies cd into the directory and execute following command:

### Berkshelf3
* `berks vendor cookbooks`

### Berkshelf 2
* `berks install --path cookbooks`

## Attributes
The file "attributes/default.rb" acts as a central configuration file.

* `default['mysql']['change_root_password']`   = true - change the password for the mysql root user. Options: `true`, `false` 
* `default['mysql']['root_password']`  = '' - Password for the mysql root user. If you install mysql through this script the root password will be blank. Options: `String`; default: blank
* `default['mysql']['new_root_password']`  = 'PW' - the new password for the mysql root user. Options: `String`
* `default['mysql']['remove_anonmymous_user']` = true - the MySql default settings allow anonymous users (black user name) to connect to the database, true will remove this behavior. Options: `true`, `false` 
* `default['mysql']['disallow_root_login']` = true - dissallow remote root login. Root login will only be possible from localhost. Options: `true`, `false` 
* `default['mysql']['remove_test_database']` = true - This option removes the default test database, which every user can access. Options: `true`, `false` 

## Usage
CD into the hardening folder and execute the command below. Hence this cookbooks installs and changes system configuration files, it must be run with root privileges.

* `sudo chef-client --local-mode --runlist 'recipe[mysql_hardening]'`

## FAQ
* If you don't want to update or install the mysql package from the system mananger, remove the line `include_recipe "mysql_hardening::check_mysql"` from "recipes/default.rb"
