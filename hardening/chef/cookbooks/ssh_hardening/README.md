# ssh_hardening - Chef cookbook

## Description
This chef cookbook consists of two recipes. The First, an easy to use recipe, "usermanagement" manages users and their ssh keys on a very basic level. You can add users and deposit a ssh key file.
The second recipe "server" provides secure ssh server configurations. Both can be used independently.

## Requirements
    * [Chef Server, Client or Chef-dk](https://www.chef.io) (tested with Chef version 12.x)
    * [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/)

## Platforms 
    * Debian 8 and later (tested, should work with older versions, too)
    * Ubuntu 14 and later (tested, should work with older versions, too)

## Dependencies
The [opscode apt cookbook](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/apt) makes sure, the apt repos√≠tory list is up to date. 
Berkshelf is used as a dependency management tool. To resolve and install all the Dependencies cd into the directory and execute following command:

### Berkshelf3
    * `berks vendor cookbooks`

### Berkshelf 2
    * `berks install --path cookbooks`    
    
## Attributes
The file "attributes/default.rb" acts as a central configuration file.

### User Management settings
This recipe creates new System-Users and puts specified SSH keys into the folder `/home/yourUserName/.ssh`. It also adds the created users to the group `sudo` if wanted. You can add more than one users if you copy and paste all the `user` entries and increment the array key. For example `['user'][1]['name']` for a second user.

* `['user'][0]['name'] 			= 'youUserName'`	The name of the new user. Options `String`
* `['user'][0]['password'] 		= 'secret'`	-	The users password as plaintext. It will be hashed with the `openssl passwd` function by the recipe. Options: `String` or `blank` if system user
* `['user'][0]['publicKey'] 	        = ["thisismypublickey", "thisismypublickey2"]`	-	Add the public keys for SSH login, seperated by ",". Options: SSH Keys (rsa, dsa) as `String`
* `['user'][0]['sudo']              	= false`	-	Adds the user to the sudo group to gain root privileges if needed. Options: `true`, `false`
* `['user'][0]['system'] 		= false`	-	If true it creates a system user without a home directory and password. Options: `true`, `false`

### SSH settings
* `['ssh']['port'] 			= [22]`	-	        Change the systems SSH port. Default is "22". Options: `Integer`
* `['ssh']['passwordAuth']		= ['no']`	-	Allow remote login via password or SSH key only. Options: `no`, `yes`
* `['ssh']['permitRootLogin']	        = ['yes']`	-	Allow remote root login. This does not affect the sudo option from above. Options: `no`, `without password`

## Usage
CD into the hardening folder and execute the command below. Hence this cookbooks installs and changes system configuration files, it must be run with root privileges.
  
  * `sudo chef-client --local-mode --runlist 'recipe[ssh_hardening]'`

## FAQ
	* If you don't want to manage your users manually or with another recipe, remove the line `include_recipe "ssh_hardening::usermanagement"` from "recipes/default.rb"
	* If you do not permit a remote root login, you need to create a non root user and add it to the sudoers file to not lock yourself out of the system. You can use the usermanagement recipe.
	* If you do not permit a remote login via password, you need to add an SSH key.
	* If you change the SSH port, add a firewall rule to still get access to the system.
