# mysql_hardening - Puppet module

## Description
This module installs or updates the mysql package via the system package manager and runs several securing actions. 
Essentially this module rewrites the, already in the mysql-server package included, "mysql_secure_installation" script for puppet automation.
The hardening and install/update modules are seperate and can be included or excluded at will.

## Requirements
* [Puppet 3.x](https://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-open-source)

## Platforms 
    * Debian 8 and later (tested, should work with older versions, too)
    * Ubuntu 14 and later (tested, should work with older versions, too)
    
# Parameters
* `[*change_mysql_pw*]` - change the password for the mysql root user. Options: `true`, `false`

* `[*new_mysql_root_pw*]` - the new password for the mysql root user. Options: `String`

* `[*remove_anonymous_user*]` - the MySql default settings allow anonymous users (black user name) to connect to the database, true will remove this behavior. Options: `true`, `false`
