# nginx_hardening - Puppet module

## Description
This module brings secure nginx settings to your system. It installs/updates the openssl and nginx package and provides you with a secure and easy to manage nginx configuration. 
All changes are made in "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf". Besides the nginx hardening, this cookbook also gives you the option of a very basic, tailored system optimization. 
Please refer to the section "Attributes" for furhter information. The hardening and install/update recipes are seperate and can be included or excluded at will.

# Usage 
Since this module installs and changes system configuration files, it must be run with root privileges.

Before you can use this module you must build it. For building it, cd into the parent directory and execute following command:

    * `puppet module build yourPath/toThe/module`
    
Once the module is built, puppet created a compressed file in `/vm-nginx_hardening/pkg/vm-nginx_hardening.-0.1.0tar.gz`. 
Now install the compressed file with:

    * `puppet module install path/to/vm-nginx_hardening.-0.1.0tar.gz`

Åƒow the module is installed on your machine and you can use the class:

    * `class { 'nginx_hardening': }
    
Custom attributes can be passed into the module like this:
    
  * `class{ 'nginx_hardening': 
                worker_processes => "18",     
        }`
        
## FAQ
If you don't want to update nginx and openssl, run the following command instead:

    * `class { 'nginx_hardening::config': }
